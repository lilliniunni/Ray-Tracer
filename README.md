# Ray-Tracer

## How to run

You can view the ray tracer by cloning the repo. You can either run the code in [Processing](https://processing.org/) or set up a simple local server. An example Python command for hosting a local server is shown below:

`python3 -m http.server 8080`

Note that based on your current Python version, the python3 command may need to be adjusted to fit your current version.

Once you have the server set up, simply go to the address that you have created. In this case, you would want to type `localhost:8080` in your browser. You should be able to view the full animation at this point.
